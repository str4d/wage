# wage

A WASM package and web app for encrypting and decrypting age-encrypted files,
powered by [rage](https://github.com/str4d/rage).

Currently an **experimental** alpha, with incomplete functionality:

- [x] Read a JavaScript File as a Rust stream.
- [x] Recipient encryption.
- [x] Recipient decryption.
- [x] Passphrase encryption.
- [x] Passphrase decryption.
- [ ] Multi-file archive-and-encrypt.
- [x] Expose a Rust stream to JavaScript as a user-downloadable file.

## Development

First, build `wage` itself as a Rust WASM package:
```
wasm-pack build
```

Then set up and run the webapp:
```
cd www
npm install
npm run serve
```

The webapp server will hot-reload on changes to the webapp itself. After
making changes to the Rust WASM package, rebuild the package and restart
the server:
```
[Ctrl+C]
cd ..
wasm-pack build
cd www
npm run serve
```
